# User Stories

As a fitness enthusiast user, I want to be able to view my exercises based on the date submitted. I want to add new exercises to my fitness tracker and see all the workouts I did in that training session. I also want to be able to make edits and delete exercises if needed.

As an instructor, I want to be able to see the student demonstrate full CRUD functionality of their website along with backend to frontend connections.


# Major Hurdles

The site was having issues connecting the front end to the backend after deployment. That is now fixed
Wasn't able to use api key from .env file so key is public (temporarily)

# Next Steps

Getting user authentication going so each workout session data is unique to each user and they can use this to track their workout habits.
Make this site into a mobile app for people to use on their phones.
